# What is Global Forest Watch?

[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) is a dynamic online forest monitoring and alert system that empowers people everywhere to better manage forests.

This repository contains the GFW web app.

# Developing

The GFW web app rides on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

## OS X Yosemite (10.10) Setup

First make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) and [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) installed.

Next install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the OS X package manager:

```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

We recommend managing your Ruby installation through [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). It's just an easy way to run multiple Ruby versions for different applications:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
$ brew install imagemagick
```

Next clone the gfw repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw.git
```

Using rbenv, install and set Ruby 2.1.0 in the main app directory:

```bash
$ cd gfw
$ rbenv install 2.1.0
$ rbenv local 2.1.0
```

Now let's install Ruby on Rails:

```bash
$ sudo gem install rails
```

Aaaaand now use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), a rubygem manager, to install all the gem depenencies for the app:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Installing front end dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower phantomjs
$ npm install -d && bower install
```

Almost there! Final steps are to update your `.env` file:

```bash
RACK_ENV=development
GFW_API_HOST=gfw-apis.appspot.com
BLOG_HOST=http://blog.globalforestwatch.org
AWS_HOST=
TERMS_COOKIE=true
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
LAYER_SPEC=layerspec_nuclear_hazard
```

Last step. For real. Start the app server and access it at [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000):

```bash
$ foreman start
```

Oh, and you should probably launch the [gfw-api](https://github.com/wri/gfw-api) [dev_apperver.py](https://github.com/wri/gfw-api#developing) before you try to visit the site on your local machine.
