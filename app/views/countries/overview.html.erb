          <p>Drag the handle to adjust the minimum tree cover canopy (TCC) density for UMD/Google tree cover and tree cover loss displayed in the graphs and rankings. TCC density represents the estimated percent of a UMD/Google pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, TCC density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover <u>before</u> loss occurred.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to the minimum TCC density will only affect UMD/Google tree cover and tree cover loss. This feature does not pertain to UMD/Google tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or statistics. UMD/Google tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%.</p>
          <p>This feature is also available for the map visualization, analysis, and for individual country profiles. The TCC density minimum selected for the overview graphs and rankings will not be applied automatically to other areas of the website.</p>

        <p>The graph displays global tree cover loss per year from 2001 through 2013. The rankings list countries from greatest to least tree cover loss from 2001 through 2013.</p>

        <p>Use the toggle button above the graph to switch the graph and rankings between gross tree cover loss (hectares) and percent tree cover loss. Percent loss is always relative to tree cover (either global or by country) in 2000.</p>

        <p>The graph and rankings visualize tree cover loss data from the University of Maryland (UMD)/Google. Due to variation in research methodology and/or date of content, this data cannot be compared accurately against tree cover and tree cover gain. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (or post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.

        <p>Please also note that “tree cover” does not equate to “forest cover.” “Tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be a part of natural forests or tree plantations. Thus, loss of tree cover may occur for many reasons, including deforestation, fire, and logging within the course of sustainable forestry operations.</p>

        <p>The graph and rankings below were created using tree cover, loss, and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google. For more information on this dataset, please visit the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/93ecbfa0542c42fdaa8454fa42a6cc27" target="_blank"> data page</a>.</p>

        <p>This graph plots the ratio of tree cover loss (2001-2013) to gain (2001-2012) against tree cover in 2000. Points that fall above the dotted line (ratio = 1) represent countries that have more loss than gain between 2001 and 2012, whereas points that fall below the line represent the opposite -- countries that have more gain than loss within the same time period. The higher the point, the greater the ratio of tree cover loss to gain.</p>

        <p>The horizontal position of the points correlates to the 2000 tree cover of the corresponding country. Points that fall far to the right represent countries with greater tree cover in 2000, whereas points that fall far to the left represent countries with less tree cover.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least ratio of tree cover loss to gain (loss/gain), for the period of 2001-2012. Large numbers (and all numbers >1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover loss, relative to gain, whereas small numbers (all numbers <1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover gain, relative to loss.</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b>Although the graph and rankings compare tree cover loss and gain, the sum of tree cover loss and gain does not equal “net loss.”</p>
