              <p>Choose a category below to learn how to conduct analysis or subscribe to alerts for an area of interest.</p>
              <p>You can define an area of interest on the map by using the drawing tool or selecting an existing polygon (such as a protected area).  Once you have defined an area of interest, you can calculate statistics about the area or subscribe to alerts. If you subscribe to alerts, you will be notified via email when a new tree cover loss alert has been detected, as often as every 30 days. Tree cover loss alerts come from the <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/39a527e300ff4146962a3c74ec476f64" target="_blank">Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA)</a> system, which monitors and detects possible tree cover disturbance within 500 × 500 meter pixels in the humid tropical forest biome.</p>

                    <p>Human society and the global economy are inextricably linked to forests. More than 1 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. Forest ecosystems also play a critical role in stabilizing the climate; providing food, water, wood products, and vital medicines; and supporting much of the world’s biodiversity.</p>

                    <p>Despite recent efforts to combat harmful deforestation in some regions, forest ecosystems are still under threat. According to <a href='http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/forest-and-landscape-restoration' target='_blank'>WRI research</a>, 30% of potential global forest cover has been cleared, while another 20% has been degraded. Most remaining forests have been fragmented, leaving only about 15% of original forest cover intact.</p>

                    <p>Balancing the demand for natural resources with the need to preserve vital ecosystems requires robust data to help resource managers make good decisions. GFW can help by providing this information at a global scale.</p>

                    <p><strong>Forest</strong></p>
                    <p>Various definitions exist for the term “forest,” and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. Data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently or pertain to different types of forest (primary, secondary, tree plantations, etc.). Through information found on the <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>, we aim to be transparent about the assumptions and definitions feeding into each data set.</p>
                    <p>In our general writing, including the GFW blog, “forest” refers to a landscape with a high density of trees and value for biodiversity, carbon storage, and human use..</p>

                    <p><strong>Deforestation</strong></p>
                    <p>How one defines “deforestation” depends on how one defines “forest.” As noted above, various definitions of forest exist and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus view. Correspondingly, GFW does not provide a single definition for “deforestation.”</p>
                    <p>In general writing, GFW uses “deforestation” to refer to the removal of a significant number of trees from a landscape, typically in the context of human actions rather than natural events such as fires or disease. We generally refer to “gross deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss), rather than “net deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss minus the amount of forest gain), or clearly specify otherwise.</p>
                    <p>For more information on each data set, please visit our <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tree cover</strong></p>
                    <p>Where found on the GFW website, “tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be part of natural forests or tree plantations. The inclusion of all types of tree plantations in the “tree cover” definition notably distinguishes the term from some definitions of “forest.” Accordingly, “tree cover” and “forest” should not be used interchangeably. Different data sets further define “tree cover” with added parameters (see the <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a> for details and distinctions).</p>

                    <p><strong>Tree cover loss</strong></p>
                    <p>“Tree cover loss” refers to the removal of trees, which may be within natural forests or tree plantations. Accordingly, “tree cover loss” does not necessarily equate to “deforestation” and can result from a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. Different data sets have additional parameters that must be met for the indication or alert of loss to appear on the GFW map (see examples below).</p>

                    <ul class='bullets'>
                      <li><strong>University of Maryland (UMD)/Google tree cover loss:</strong> Loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal or mortality of tree cover canopy (of any canopy cover density) at the Landsat pixel scale (30 × 30 meters).</li>

                      <li><strong>FORMA alerts:</strong> Loss alerts are triggered by areas exhibiting a steep, persistent drop in vegetation intensity, indicating a high probability (equal to or greater than 50%) of the occurrence of tree cover loss. It is important to note that this alert-based system is not the same as an area measurement of tree cover loss.</li>

                  <div class='source_summary'>
                    <p>Tree plantations are not distinguished from natural forests in the case of several key data sets hosted on GFW (including 2000 tree cover, UMD/Google tree cover loss and gain, FORMA alerts, and QUICC alerts). Tree cover loss may include cases of tree plantations being harvested, and tree cover gain may include cases where natural forests are replaced with tree plantations.</p>

                    <p>It is nonetheless important to <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/805.full' target='_blank'>distinguish</a> between natural forests and tree plantations when considering conservation, carbon storage, and value to local communities. Natural forests have higher biodiversity, store more carbon, and are more often associated with the traditional livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Accordingly, GFW and partners are developing a “plantation forests map” for the tropical regions to determine the location of plantations on a near-global scale. The map, developed through remote sensing methods, will be coming soon to GFW.</p>

Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (or post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.

                    <p>Different data sets measure different things and are derived using different methodologies. Such differences can lead to results that may manifest as contradictory layers on the GFW platform. In some cases, a lack of available high-quality data may cause a greater margin of error for certain data sets.</p>

                    <ul class='bullets'>
                      <li><p><strong>Intact Forest Landscapes vs. tree cover:</strong> These data sets measure different things. “Tree cover” shows all 30 × 30 meter areas that meet a minimum threshold of tree cover (25% canopy cover), whereas “Intact Forest Landscapes” only shows forests that show no significant signs of human activity (see the <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/" target="_blank">Open data Portal</a> for specifics).</p>

                      <p>Users may find instances where tree cover does not fall within the boundaries of intact forest landscapes. This is because the Intact Forest Landscapes layer is based on MODIS (250 meter resolution satellite imagery), which is known to overestimate low tree cover densities, whereas the tree cover layer is based on Landsat (30 meter resolution satellite imagery). As a result, the tree cover layer may not show tree cover in an area that is covered by an intact forest landscape polygon.</p></li>
                      <li><p><strong>Google base map vs. boundary of country data sets:</strong> In some cases, country data sets do not line up with the Google base map and data may appear outside the country boundary. Not all country data sets are derived using the same base map and therefore there may be a slight degree of incongruence.</p></li>

                  <strong class='source_title'>What is tree cover canopy (TCC) density and what layers allow me to adjust it?</strong>
                  <i class='expand_arrow'></i>

                  <div class='source_summary'>
                    <p>Not all forests have the same footprint. Some forests are dense, like the tropical Amazon, with canopies that blanket almost every inch of ground for miles. Others forests are sparse, such as the savannah woodlands of North Africa where the canopies do not close or interlace. There are many shades in between. As a result, there is no global consensus on how much tree cover is needed to constitute a forest and it is important to be able to adjust the tree cover canopy density according to different user or country definitions of “forest.”</p>

                   <p>The minimum tree cover canopy density can only be adjusted within the UMD/Google tree cover and loss data sets. When these layers are activated in the map, you can adjust the minimum percentage of canopy density through the settings icon. This adjustment can also be made in other areas of the website where UMD/Google forest statistics are used, such as within the country profiles and rankings.</p>

                   <p>What do these percentages mean? Technically speaking, tree cover canopy density represents the estimated percent of a pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, tree cover canopy density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover before loss occurred. For example, if you select 25% as the minimum tree cover canopy density, you will only see tree cover loss pixels for which the original tree cover density was greater than 25%.</p>

                   <p>Note: Adjustments to the minimum TCC density only affect UMD tree cover loss and extent data layers. This feature does not pertain to UMD tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or statistics. UMD tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%. The minimum TCC density cannot be changed independently for loss and extent. A change made to one data layer will immediately take effect in the other.</p>

                    <p>Raster refers to a type of spatial data, which defines space by pixels, or equally sized cells arranged by rows and columns. Each pixel contains a single attribute value and its coordinate location. Pixel values correspond to real-world features such as the year tree cover was lost, or the percent of canopy cover in that location.</p>
                    <h3 class="overview_title">Steps to download raster data in the ODP:</h3>
                    <p><strong>1. Find and open a raster data set</strong> in the Open Data Portal, for example, <a class="download-mobile-link" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/93ecbfa0542c42fdaa8454fa42a6cc27">tree cover loss</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.</strong> Since <strong>global data sets cannot be downloaded</strong> for the entire world, use the interactive web-map to zoom in on your area of interest. The extent of the web-map will determine the extent of your data, when downloaded.</p>
                    <p><%= image_tag('howto-screenshots/odp/image14.jpg') %></p>
                    <p><strong>3. Select "DOWNLOAD DATASET"</strong> and choose one of the data types under the “Download Filtered Dataset” section. The TIFF format is encoded with raster values and is spatially referenced so you can add it to a GIS.</p>
                    <p><%= image_tag('howto-screenshots/odp/image15.jpg') %></p>
                    <p><strong>4.</strong> Once you select a download format from the “DOWNLOAD DATASET” button, your download will begin. Download times may vary based on the size of your data request. Having trouble downloading a data set? <a href="mailto:astrong@wri.org">Let us know!</a></p>

                    <h3 class="overview_title">Steps to Download Raster Data by Country:</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to download the tree cover loss raster data set for an entire country is to search for that country in the Open Data Portal. The GFW team is committed to making more of our global raster data sets downloadable by country.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.</strong> From the Open Data Portal homepage navigate to the <strong>“VIEW COUNTRY DATA” search box</strong>.</p>
                    <p><%= image_tag('howto-screenshots/odp/image17.jpg') %></p>
                    <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Use the drop-down menu to select a country of interest.</strong> for example, Brazil.</p>
                    <p><strong>3.</strong> In the search results page, <strong>select the tree cover loss data</strong> for that country (Brazil tree cover loss), and your download should start immediately.</p>
