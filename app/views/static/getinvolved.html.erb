                  <p>Established in 2014, the Small Grants Fund seeks to promote broad uptake and innovative use of Global Forest Watch by civil society. The Small Grants Fund provides financial and technical support to civil society organizations that want to use Global Forest Watch in their research, advocacy, and fieldwork. The fund provides grants between US$10,000 and US$40,000.</p>

                  <h3>Learn about the 2014 recipients</h3>
                  <p><strong>Perkumpulan Rincong (Indonesia).</strong> Perkumpulan Rincong’s project aimed to enable forest-dependent communities around the Ulu Masen Forest in Aceh, Indonesia to establish and monitor sustainable management of their customary forest through improved capacity to utilize GFW as a tool for understanding, protecting and promoting their natural resources. The project involved training indigenous forest rangers on how to target their patrols using GFW data, creating a forest management plan.</p>
                  <p><strong>GERES (Cambodia).</strong> GERES partnered with Mlup Baitong in Cambodia to estimate the relative impacts of charcoal production on deforestation in the Northern Cardamoms forest while also developing a participatory methodology combining GIS data from the GFW website, surveys and participatory workshops. GERES staff and partners concluded that the impact of charcoal production on forests is highly connected with landscape changes and cannot be isolated from the impact of agriculture and other drivers of forest degradation or deforestation.</p>
                  <p><strong>Blue Ventures (Madagascar).</strong> Blue Ventures improved community management of mangrove forests in coastal Madagascar by modeling the rate and scope of deforestation and then supporting the effort to establish legally-recognized community rights to mangrove management. The data Blue Ventures collected and validated were shown to government officials, helping them appreciate the rapid rate of mangrove deforestation in the region. This fostered political support for community-led mangrove management and assistance for community boards that monitor these plans.</p>
                  <p><strong>Friends of Siberian Forests (Russia).</strong> The Friends of Siberian Forests convened ten forest advocates from Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Buryat and Zabaikalsk territories in Siberia to create a network of ‘Forest Watchers’. They met for a three-day workshop in Krasnoyarsk to learn how to use GFW and begin developing a strategy for how to use the platform in their work. The workshop found that the data for the boreal forests in Siberia is sparse, which is a major obstacle for incorporating GFW into project work. Eventually, participants identified pulp and paper mills as the main focus.</p>
                  <p><strong>Amazon Conservation Association (Ecuador/Peru).</strong> The Amazon Conservation Association validated GFW FORMA alerts and compared them to Landsat-based deforestation data to establish an effective deforestation monitoring system for the Andean Amazon. The ACA analyzed 19,322 alerts along with 8,976 Terra-I alerts, then analyzed the results in relation to key contextual data to develop a web portal called the <a href="http://maaproject.org/" target="_blank">Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP)</a>. Based on their results, ACA was able to identify key areas like the Yasuní National Park in Ecuador where there is a high level of false positives.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Ecological Society (India).</strong> The Ecological Society (ES) re-assessed local land-use and evaluated the ecological status of the Panshet Dam catchment in order to create a restoration template for conservation programs in Northern Western Ghats. The resulting study found that only a few patches of land continue to support “endemic and special biodiversity” and that there is an urgent need to protect these remaining patches. Using the data they collected, ES developed a template for forest restoration in Northern Western Ghats and created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbohysTDS6k" target="_blank">video</a> to explain their findings.</p>
                  <p><strong>Private Institute for Climate Change Research (Guatemala).</strong> Private Institute for Climate Change Research (ICC) convened a variety of stakeholders to examine the ways that GFW is useful for forest management in Guatemala, with a focus on national forest cover data. Through a series of workshops and trainings, ICC discovered significant differences between national government data and GFW data, due in large part to differences in mapping methodologies and forest cover definitions. However, GFW proved to be very useful for monitoring forest cover within forest concessions and protected areas.</p>
                  <p><strong>Instituto Centro de Vida (Brazil).</strong> ICV used GFW to provide strategic information on the extent and cost of illegal logging in Mato Grosso (MT). Their study found that over 50% of all logging in the Mato Grosso State between August 2011 and July 2012 was operated without authorization from the State Secretariat for the Mato Grosso Environment (Sema/MT). After a GFW workshop, the Timber Union in Mato Grosso decided to create a taskforce to monitor illegal logging. In addition, the State environment agency also began to map illegality in forest operations.</p>
                  <p><strong>Public Interest Law Foundation (Sri Lanka).</strong> The Public Interest Law Foundation (PILF) worked closely with government agencies and civil society groups to use GFW to identify potential deforestation hotspots, which revealed a lack of adequate enforcement. PILF published a series of stories about GFW related to deforestation in the traditional media. Working with community groups, PILF investigated complaints about illegal deforestation in preparation for possible litigation. Finally, through a series of workshops, PILF trained journalists, NGOs and government officials on how to use the platform.</p>
