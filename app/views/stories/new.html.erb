      <h3>TELL US YOUR STORY!</h3>
      <p>Global Forest Watch is not just about big data; it is a movement to connect people on the ground with information that can create tangible change.

You can submit a story by sharing text and uploading images, video, or web links to show how forests are being managed, cleared, or protected in your area.</p>

        <li><strong>Be brief:</strong> The User Stories layer is intended to highlight your story and direct readers to other materials with additional details. Keep your story short and concrete.
        <li><strong>Add media:</strong> Utilize media quotations, technical articles, and publications from well-known sources. We recommend you use high quality videos or pictures to document your case.
        <li><strong>Provide hard facts:</strong> Describe the region of your story using specific details: size, type of forest, forest change, etc.
        <li><strong>Highlight your organization:</strong> Include the name of your organization on the story, as well as your website or contact information.
