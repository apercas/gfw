      introduction: |
        Global Forest Watch (GFW) is an initiative convened by the <a href="http:\\www.wri.org" target="_blank">World Resources Institute</a> that unites technology, transparency, and human networks to mobilize more timely and effective forest conservation and sustainable forest management. GFW combines near-real-time forest monitoring, forest management boundary maps, protected areas, mobile technology, crowd-sourced data, and a networked world to create never-before-possible forest transparency.

        We welcome others to join our growing GFW partnership.
